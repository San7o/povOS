The bootloader just slapped you in x86_64 long (protected) mode with a
flat memory layout. You are ring 0, you can do anything. You don't
have access to the fancy BIOS routines anymore, so you will have to
get creative and implement your own drivers, but you have a full
64-bit address space and the power of CISC to play with. Have fun.

Check out uart.asm for an example driver.

The boot sequence
-----------------

The classic boot sequence looks like this:

 - CPU starts executing in 16-bit real mode, with BIOS access
 - Use the bios to load the rest of the bootloader
 - Setup and load the GDT with a flat memory layout
 - Go to protected mode
 - Setup GDT again
 - Setup the page table
 - Enable the A20 line
 - Enable long mode
 - Call the main routine
